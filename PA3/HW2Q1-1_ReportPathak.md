# Q1-1: Comparison of Running Times

## Problem
We analyze the computational complexity of different functions and determine how many operations each can handle within different time constraints.

## Assumptions
- A computer is able to execute **one operation per second**.
- We analyze for these following limits:
  - 1 second
  - 1 minute (60 seconds)
  - 1 hour (3,600 seconds)
  - 1 day (86,400 seconds)
  - 1 month (2,592,000 seconds)
  - 1 year (31,536,000 seconds)
  - 1 century (3,153,600,000 seconds)

## Functions Considered
We analyze the growth functions:
1. **log(n)** - Logarithmic growth
2. **sqrt(n)** - Square root growth
3. **n** - Linear growth
4. **n log(n)** - Linearithmic growth
5. **n²** - Quadratic growth
6. **n³** - Cubic growth
7. **2^n** - Exponential growth
8. **n!** - Factorial growth

## Computation 
- We calculated the maximum **n** each function holds.
- Large numbers are expressed in **scientific notation** to avoid overflow.
- **log(n) and n!** are approximated where necessary.
