#  CSCI 3421 PA3

This assignment focuses on algorithmic complexity, sorting performance, mathematical proof techniques, and HTML formatting. It is divided into multiple questions, including theoretical analysis, implementation of sorting algorithms, performance benchmarking, and a loop invariant proof.

##  Q1: Asymptotic Analysis and Proofs

- **Q1-1:** Create an HTML table comparing growth rates of various functions (CLRS 1.1), assuming 30 days/month and 365 days/year. Include explanations in Markdown or PDF.
- **Q1-2:** Prove a mathematical statement using induction.
- **Q1-3:** Prove the minimum number of weighings needed to find a counterfeit coin using induction.

---

##  Q2: Sorting Algorithm Benchmarking

Compare **Insertion Sort** (inefficient) with **Merge Sort** (efficient) using large datasets and record:
- Runtime using `timeEfficiency()` function from HW1
- Number of comparisons made
- Visual graph of performance across various data sizes

---

##  Q3: Loop Invariant Proof (5 pts)

Prove the correctness of the `merge()` function in your Merge Sort using the **loop invariant** method. Include:
1. General definition of loop invariant
2. Your merge loop's invariant
3. Initialization
4. Maintenance
5. Termination

## Extra Credit: Auto-Generated HTML Table (10 pts)

Write a Python program that generates the table from **Q1-1** as a valid `.html` file using `math`, `numpy`, or similar modules. Use either HTML libraries or file writing functions to format output properly for browser display.


## Topics Practiced

- Asymptotic analysis and mathematical modeling
- Sorting algorithm performance
- Induction and loop invariants
- HTML formatting
- Scientific notation and large number handling in Python
